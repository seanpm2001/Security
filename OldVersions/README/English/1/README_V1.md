# Security

> **Warning** _Do not submit security reports to this repository. Also, do not send security reports without properly reading the `SECURITY.md` file of the repository.

My repositories have various security policies, depending on how developed they are. The most common (and default for newer repositories) is [this variant:](/SECURITY.md)

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a Git-image project, and doesn't have security issues like common repositories. They are still possible, and instructions will be listed below.

## Version history

| Version | Supported          | Support status |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| Versions | not | listed yet |
| v1.0.0    | :heavy_check_mark: | NOT YET RELEASED |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, message me via email at [seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)
